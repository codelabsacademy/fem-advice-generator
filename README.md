## Introduction

This is one of the coding challenges for the Fundamentals unit of the web development bootcamp offered by [Code Labs Academy](https://codelabsacademy.com/). In this unit, we learn the major concepts of HTML, CSS and JavaScript while providing challenges and homeworks for an optimal hands-on learning experience.

## Challenge description

This is one of [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/) challenges. The challenge is to build out an advice generator app using the [Advice Slip API](https://api.adviceslip.com/) and get it looking as close to as possible to the design below:

We already prepared the HTML and the CSS for you. Now your mission is to make the advice generator functional by fetching data from the provided API.
